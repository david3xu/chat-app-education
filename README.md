# ask cursor: claude-3.5-sonnet

app/page.tsx:
# please make the background dark
# I need 2 sections. One on the left should be a 300px wide sidebar, and the one on the right will be for rendering the chat
# clink apply button 
# click a new chat: 
# please add a sidebar icon that when clicked toggles the sidebar : FaBars
# please use the lucide icons library instead: apply -> ctrl+enter
# when the sidebar is open please put the icon on the top left of it, and when it's closed put it in the top left of the screen
# include "use client"
# at the botton of the chat section, we need a textarea and inside of the textarea should be a send button on the right side that has a send icon @package.json pleae use the autosize input
# it should take up a maximum of 800px

# So we're going to need an area to render messages, please add that area between a chat title at the top and the textarea at the bottom 
# give a color to the message of User and AI


# awesome, let's finally use the @stream-message.ts function to make a call to the openai api and stream that message back when we submit our input 
# in "Type your message...", let enter button work 
# in the 'User' 'AI' area, only color the message 
# debuging: ctrl+shift+i 
# shift+enter to give more space

# So when the message is done streaming it doesn't render in the ui
# put the user messages on the right and the assistant on the left
# in the top of the sidebar, there should be a create icon that allows us to create a new chat. These chats should be saved to local storage. 

each chat should have an id, a name, and an array of messages @stream-message.ts 
# use current datetime as id

# why the ai response not show in the chat area?
# so mostly looks good on the save stuff, but when messages get streamed in and saved they disappear from the ui 

# hey when I press the enter key can you submit my new message, dont send though when i also have shift held down 

# when i hover over my chats in the sdebar, on the rightside it should show a trash icon that when clicked should pop up an @alert-dialog.tsx

# it seems like the display is outside of the area?
# it seems that the output display at the same time, can you display word by word, when the llm generate words?

# it seems that the model contines generate answer, no stop?

# Do you have any idea for chat history ?

# @app @actions @components @lib @supabase  can you give exact step for the above chat history implementation?

# after the implementation of the history chat, the conversation between user and assistant appeared and removed from chat area.  @ChatContext.tsx @route.ts @questionAnswering.ts @ChatArea.tsx @MessageInput.tsx  answer again using the docs.

# it continues generate the requests?

# you remove my user input in the chat area again? 

# on each conversation, the project stored three rows data, what is the storing process and related data? search all the project

it seems that user content was not add to the current message? @MessageInput.tsx @ChatArea.tsx @ChatContext.tsx 
#solution: Finally, let's modify the ChatContext.tsx to ensure it's correctly updating the state:

# add "Select Domination Field" in the "Chat Area"

# can you add one processing shadow icon when generating the answer ? 

# move the loading icon to the left 

# add classification field choice when ask AI

# add multimodel choice, ask image questions

# interact with personal notes
